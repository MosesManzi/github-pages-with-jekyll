Dear Moses,
Thank you so much for your extraordinary support during these recent challenging days when many teachers were out sick. I am extremely grateful for your support in organizing and supporting teaching assistants to cover for teachers. I also thank you for encouraging and supporting teaching assistants who had to deal with a reduction in pay in February. I know that was very difficult for them and that your encouragement and support helped them get through that tough time.
